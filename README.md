# Vietnamese to Mandarin dictionary - wikitionary-zh-allentries.tsv

This is a work in progress, entirely composed of data from the Mandarin language Wiktionary (zh.wiktionary.org).

At the moment it is an entirely /raw/ rip (a lot of the wiki markup is still there), and abandons all the pronunciation templates.

I figure I'll put it up as I refine it because well, until now there wasn't a *single* open source vietnamese-mandarin (or even Mandarin-Vietnamese) dictionary source.

Also, be aware, it is missing an absolute butt tonne of words. Awkward.
