# Open sourced dictionaries

In the world of Vietnamese language dictionaries, there are few open source dictionaries. And you'll even find that the bulk of apps out there are just flagrantly stealing data... so I'm gonna try and kickstart some better data by processing Wiktionary into tab separated files people can use in their own apps.

# Vietnamese to Mandarin dictionary - vi2zhwikitxt.txt

## VN-ZH VIE-ZH VIE-CHN

This is a work in progress, entirely composed of data from the Mandarin language Wiktionary (zh.wiktionary.org).

At the moment it is an entirely /raw/ rip (a lot of the wiki markup is still there), and abandons all the pronunciation templates.

I figure I'll put it up as I refine it because well, until now there wasn't a *single* open source vietnamese-mandarin (or even Mandarin-Vietnamese) dictionary source.

Also, be aware, it is missing an absolute butt tonne of words. Awkward.

### 一点翻译器的中文

这是一项正在进行的工作，完全由普通话维基词典(zh.wiktionary.org)的数据组成

目前，它完全是原始数据(很多wiki标记仍然存在)，并且抛出了所有的发音资料

我知道，太早上忘了，但是因为到目前为止，还没有的越南语对普通话 (甚至是普通话-越南语) 词典来源。

最后，请注意，它绝对遗漏了一大堆话。：）

# Vietnamese to English dictionary - vi2enwikitxt.txt
Pretty much the same as above, but generated from the English Wiktionary (en.wiktionary.org)

Again, a reminder that this data is hella raw and honestly some work is needed - but hey maybe you'll get some use out of it in its current state -- honestly I've stripped out a bunch of fields I find uninteresting for a dictionary. I'll probably work on getting them back into the data at some point.
